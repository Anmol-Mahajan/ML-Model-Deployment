# ML-Model-Deployment

This project focuses on deploying a machine learning model for mobile price prediction using AWS SageMaker. The deployment process involves utilizing Jupyter Lab and writing a Python script for the deployment code. Additionally, all the relevant files required for the deployment are stored on AWS S3.


# Project Steps
1. Data Preparation: The project begins with data preparation, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis. The dataset consists of various features related to mobile phones, such as battery power, RAM, camera features, and more.

2. Model Training and Evaluation: A machine learning model is built and trained using the prepared dataset. The model is evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess its performance and accuracy in predicting mobile prices.

3. Model Deployment with AWS SageMaker: The trained model is deployed on AWS SageMaker, a cloud machine learning platform provided by Amazon Web Services. AWS SageMaker offers scalable and efficient infrastructure to host and manage machine learning models.

4. Jupyter Lab Integration: Jupyter Lab, an interactive development environment, is used to streamline the deployment process. Python scripts are written within Jupyter Lab to facilitate the deployment of the mobile price prediction model on AWS SageMaker.

5. AWS S3 Storage: All the relevant files required for the deployment, including the trained model and associated resources, are stored on AWS S3. This ensures easy access and retrieval of the necessary files during the deployment process.
